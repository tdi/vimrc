-------

* [tcomment](https://github.com/tomtom/tcomment_vim) for commenting (example command gcc)
* [taglist](https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar) for tags (mapping F8)
* [nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree] for file manager (mapping `CTRL-n`)
* supertab for Tab completion (just use Tab, it will detect which mode is the best)


It also has: buftabs, powerline,vim-indent-object, vim-surround, zoomwin.

If you do not want to use only `hjkl`, just remove these mapping from `.vimrc`. 

Other mappings:

* `Ctrl-[hjkl]` will move around buffers

* `F10` toggles paste mode (you can now paste with mouse in insert mode)
* `jj` in insert mode is mapped to `Esc`
* `ze` and `zE` switch on and off spell checker for UK english, `zp` and `zP` for Polish, `zus` for American english
* CTRL-w o zooms in and out of a selected window
